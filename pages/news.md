## News

Since Fedora 35, the repository is called Audinux (due to a conflict with the website linuxmao.org).

I will stop building the RT kernel 5.15 because it has too many problems with audio (the USB Audio driver seems to have a lot of problems and doesn't play well with pipewire).

Build of Fedora 41 and Rawhide version is not over (4 days of rebuild). Now it's time to fix the broken packages.
