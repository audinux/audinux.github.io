## News

Fedora 34 has reach end of life. The LinuxMAO is no more updated and will be disabled soon.
Since Fedora 35, the repository is called Audinux (due to a conflict with the website linuxmao.org).

Fedora 35 has been tagged EOL (End Of Life)
So, it's time to move to Fedora 36 or 37.

I will stop building the RT kernel 5.15 because it has too many problems with audio (the USB Audio driver seems to have a lot of problems and doesn't play well with pipewire).

I started the build of packages for Fedora 38 - x86_64 / aarch64.
