- **Audinux: Fedora Audio Production Environment** 

- **Practical audio routing and monitoring**
  The goal is to help new users get sound working *first*, then gradually explore the deeper features of the system.
  
- **Understand Your Voice Chain**  
  From input (mic or instrument) to output (speakers/headphones), understand how audio flows in a basic setup using PipeWire or JACK.

- **Build Your Audio Workflow**  
  Learn how to connect software instruments, audio effects, and DAWs using Carla, JACK Patchbay, or similar tools.

- **Monitor and Test Sound**  
  Make sure your inputs and outputs are routed correctly. Learn how to monitor levels and avoid xruns or silent devices.

- **Use Racks and Patchbays Visually**  
  Use Carla to easily connect plugins and audio sources just like physical hardware.
